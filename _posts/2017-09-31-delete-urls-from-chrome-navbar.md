Sometimes you've accidentally typed a URL into Chrome and now it shows up each time you try to enter the original URL. How do you get rid of that annoying entry? 

Simple. For example, in the screen below, I want to remove the entry www.bb.com (or any other incorrect search string for that matter) that I had accidentally entred earlier. I type "bb" first, scroll down to the unwanted entry and hit SHIFT DELETE. The unwanted entry would be removed.
